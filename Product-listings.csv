"MAD Apparel, Inc.",17269,159929,0,0,A100,,Athos Core,"The Core is the brain of the system; it contains the electronics and intelligence to collect and interpret bio signals, sending the information to mobile devices via Bluetooth Low Energy.

The Core has black outer plastic surfaces and is approximately 64mm x 33mm x 16mm (L x W x H) in dimensions. It has 38 sensor points that are used to measure bio signals and 4 metallic points that are used to charge the internal LiPo battery of the Core. The Core has two LED slits for indicator lights. There are no other external physical interfaces other than the 42 contact points on the bottom side of the Core. 

The Core can last up to 10 hours of continuous operation on a single battery charge. The Core is inserted into the garment product which has a mount with sensor points that the Core will contact. The sensor points are connected to passive sensors throughout the garment that will bring the bio signals to the Core. The signals are then filtered and processed by the Core and then sent by the Core over Bluetooth Low Energy to mobile devices to be displayed to the user.
